Azera is just a concept right now and will probably never be developed into a fully functioning product.
At the current moment in time, Azera serves as a testing ground to develop my C development skills as well as helping me develop my understanding of CS.
Azera has no end goal, and is purely a programming excercise.

Feel free to do whatever with the stuff you find here.
